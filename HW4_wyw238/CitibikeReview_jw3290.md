## CitiBike Review

### 1. Hypothesis formulation

The null hypothesis is well-written (except the formula ins't displayed properly), and it provides a significance level for testing.
For the idea, it suggests that if the number of young people using citibike at weekend is greater than that during weekdays, it means young people are more likely to choose biking to commute. However, this could also happen if there are more young people go out at weekend than they do during weekdays.

### 2. Data assessment

The data needed for this testing inlcudes age and date. Two variables, birth year and date, are applied in the model. 

### 3. Statistical test suggestion

Based on the sample size and varialbes used in this model, I would suggest using z-test for hypothesis testing. The sample size is large(n>30), which makes z-test a more suitable method than t-test for this model. The question asked in this model is whether people in young age group are more likely to use bikes at weekend than people in old age group. To tell the difference between two groups on one dependent variable, we can use z-test.

### 4. Next Step

Based on the model, the variable "date" only tells the number of people using citibike at weekend, but it doesn't take the duration of their trips into account. If the model can add the duration of trip at weekend as another variable, we can examine the relation between biking and age at weekend in a more comprehensive way.
